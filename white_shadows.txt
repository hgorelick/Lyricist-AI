When I was a young boy
I tried to listen
And I want to feel like that
Little white shadows
Blink and miss them
Part of a system I am

If you ever feel like something's missing
Things you'll never understand
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten
Part of a system, a plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up
Oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

When I was a young boy
I tried to listen
Don't you want to feel like that?
You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of the system, a plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up
Oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

Swimming on a sea of faces
The tide of the human race, and so
An answer now is what I need
I see it in the new sun rising
I see it break on your horizon, oh
Come on love, stay with me''''''''''''''''''''
