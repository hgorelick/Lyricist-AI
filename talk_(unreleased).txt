Under the great north star
Try to work out where you are
In the silence of the sea
I don't know where I've been
In the future, in the past
Going nowhere much too fast
When I go there go with me
Oh when I go there go with me

'Cause I don't know where I'm going but I wanna talk
I feel like I'm going where I've been before
And I wanna talk

Take a picture of
Something that you're not sure of
Bring it back to show me
But I don't know what I see
In the future, find a home
Getting nowhere on your own
Got to find your missing piece

'Cause you don't know where you're going but you wanna talk
You feel like you're going where you've been before
And nothing's really making any sense at all
You'll tell any one who'll listen that you feel ignored
Let's talk, let's talk
Do you wanna talk?

I'm up in the part of the throne
I'm trying to sing a song
In a language I don't speak
I try but I can't get through
I'm trying to get to you
But you're difficult to reach

Won't you talk... to... me...

So you don't know where you're going but you wanna talk
You feel like you're going where you've been before

Let's talk, let's talk...
Let's talk, let's talk...''''''''''''''''
