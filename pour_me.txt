Poor me, floating out to sea 
An opportunity that went bad 
Poor you, now what you gonna do? 
Now what you gonna do? 
You just cry 

Poor me, so blind I couldn't see
The forest for the trees
I don't know why
Poor you, you split yourself in two
Now what you gonna do?
You just cry

I hear you, come nearer 
I hear you but I don't understand 
I hear you, come nearer 
I hear you but I don't understand 

Poor me, floating out to sea 
An opportunity that went bad 
Poor you, now what you gonna do? 
Oh, what you gonna do? 
You just cry 

I hear you, come nearer 
I hear you but I don't understand 
I hear you, come nearer 
I hear you but I don't understand 

I don't understand 
I don't understand''''''''''''''
