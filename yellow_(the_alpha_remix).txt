Look At The Stars
Look How They Shine For You
And Everything You Do
Yeah They Were All Yellow
I Came Along 
I Wrote A Song For You
And All The Things You Do
And It Was Called Yellow
So Then I Took My Turn 
Oh What A Thing To Have Done
And It Was All Yellow

Your Skin
Oh Yeah Your Skin And Bones
Turn Into Something Beautiful
And You Know
You Know I Love You So
You Know I Love You So

I Swam Across
I Jumped Across For You
Oh What A Thing To Do
'Cos You Were All Yellow
I Drew A Line
I Drew A Line For You
Oh What A Thing To Do
And It Was All Yellow

And Your Skin
Oh Yeah Your Skin And Bones
Turn Into Something Beautiful
And You Know
For You I Bleed Myself Dry
For You I Bleed Myself Dry

It's True
Look How They Shine For You
Look How They Shine For You
Look How They Shine For
Look How They Shine For You
Look How They Shine For You
Look How They Shine''''''''''''''
