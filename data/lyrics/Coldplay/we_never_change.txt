I wanna live life, never be cruel
I wanna live life, be good to you
I wanna fly, never come down
And live my life, and have friends around

We never change, do we? No, no... We never learn, do we?
So I wanna live in a wooden house

I wanna live life, always be true
I wanna live life, and be good to you
I wanna fly, and never come down
And I live my life, and have friends around

We never change, do we? No, no... We never learned to leave
So I wanna live in a wooden house
Making more friends would be easy
Oh and I don't have a show to say, yes, and I sin every single day
We never change, do we? We never learned to leave
So, I wanna live in a wooden house
Making more friends would be easy
I wanna live where the sun comes out''''''''''''''''''''
