Trying hard to speak and
Fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
It's all part of the plan
When something is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way you can

I dive in at the deep end
She become my best friend
I want to love you
But I don't know if I can
I know something is broken
And I'm trying to fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way I can

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

You and me are floating on a tidal wave together
You and me are drifting into outer space and singing
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

You and me are floating on a tidal wave together
You and me are drifting into outer space
You and me are floating on a tidal wave together
You and me are drifting into outer space and singing

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh''''''''''''''''''''''
