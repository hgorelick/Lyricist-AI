Come on, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And if I, oh if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole

Come here, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear, I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole

But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath

And time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
Oh, it's no cause for concern

Stuck on the end
Of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again

Stood on a bridge
Tied to a noose
Sick to the stomach

You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets

Stood on the edge
Tied to a noose
And you came along
And you cut me loose

You came along
And you cut me loose
You came along
And you cut me loose''''''''''''''''''''''
