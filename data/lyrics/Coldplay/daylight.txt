To my surprise, and my delight
I saw a sunrise, I saw sunlight
I am nothing in the dark
And the clouds burst to show daylight

Ooh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Ooh and I realize
Who cannot live without
Ooh come apart without
It

On a hilltop, on a sky-rise
Like a firstborn child
And at full tilt, and in full flight
Defeat darkness, breaking daylight

Ooh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Ooh and I realized
Who cannot live without
Ooh come apart without
Daylight

Slowly breaking through daylight
Slowly breaking through daylight
Slowly breaking through daylight
Slowly breaking through daylight''''''''''''''''''''
