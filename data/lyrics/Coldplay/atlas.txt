Some saw the sun
Some saw the smoke
Some heard the gun
Some bent the bow
Sometimes the wire
Must tense for the note
Caught in the fire
Say oh, we're about to explode

Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world
I'll carry your world

Some far away
Some search for gold
Some dragon to slay
Heaven, we hope, is just up the road
Show me the way Lord
Because I'm, I'm about to explode

Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world and all your hurt
Carry your world
Carry your world''''''''''''''''''
