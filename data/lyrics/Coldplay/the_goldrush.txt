I went digging for gold
I went down through the valley
Over by the mountain
Where the prospector had been told
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold

I went digging for gold
I went down with my brother
A bucket and a shovel
And a book about the colour of coal
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold

There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
Saying "What use the metal if the metal don't shine?"
She said "Bring me back a ring 'cause I really want one"
I've been digging so long that I never see the sun
