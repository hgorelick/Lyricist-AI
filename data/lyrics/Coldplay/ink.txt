Got a tattoo that said, 'together thru life'
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
And you wonder when you wake up will it be all right?
Feels like there's something broken inside

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Got a tattoo and the pain's all right
Just want a way of keeping you inside

All I know 
All I know 
Is that I'm lost 
In your fire below
All I know 
Is that I love you so 
So much that it hurts 

I see the road begin to climb
I see your stars begin to shine
I see your colours, and I'm dying of thirst
All I know 
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

So much that it hurts

So much that it hurts''''''''''''''''''
