Oooooo
Oooooo

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Oooooo
Oooooo

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night
She'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night
Away she'd fly

And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh

She dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh

La la la-la la-la
La la la-la la-la
La la la-la la-la
La la la

Still lying underneath the stormy skies
She said, oh
I know the sun is set to rise

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh

Oh-oh oooooo

This could be para-para-paradise
Could be para-para-paradise
Could be para-para-paradise
Oh

Oooooo
Oooooo
Oooooo
Oooooo''''''''''''''''''
