So you lost your trust
And you never should have
And you never should have
But don't break your back
If you ever see this
Don't answer that

In a bullet-proof vest
With the windows all closed
I'll be doing my best
I'll see you soon

In a telescope lens
And when all you want is friends
I'll see you soon

So they came for you
They came snapping at your heels
They come snapping at your heels
But don't break your back
If you ever say this
But don't answer that

In a bullet-proof vest
With the windows all closed
I'll be doing my best
I'll see you soon

In a telescope lens
And when all you want is friends
I'll see you soon
I'll see you soon

I know, you lost your trust
I know, you lost your trust
I know, don't lose your trust
I know, you lost your trust''''''''''''''''''
