Lovers In Japan
Lovers, keep on the road you're on
Runners, until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even the right is wrong

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, we're gonna get out

Tonight, maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Ohohohoh ohohohoh oh
Dreaming of when the morning comes 

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down 
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, the sun will come out

Reign Of Love
Reign of love
I can't let go
To the sea I offer this heavy load
Locust wind
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner in a reign of love

Locust wind
Let us stop
How I wish I'd spoken up
To a reign of love

Reign of love by the church we're waiting
Reign of love on my knees go praying
How I wish I'd spoken up
Away get carried on a reign of love''''''''''''''''''
