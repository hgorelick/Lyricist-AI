I think of you
I haven't slept
I think I do, but
I don't forget
My body moves
Goes where I will
But though I try my heart stays still
It never moves, just won't be led

And so my mouth waters to be fed
And you're always in my head

You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head

You're always in my head
Always in my
Always in my

This, I guess
Is to tell you you're chosen
Out from the rest''''''''''''''''''''
