Those wedding bells ringing up upon that hill
And I don't wanna swallow such a bitter pill
You keep on moving but I stay still
But I always loved you and I always will
Days of no sleeping caked in mud
All kinds of poison in my blood
I lost the only thing I ever loved
I heard them ringing in precession by
Umbrellas in that clear blue sky
Saw you swimming in that sea of white
Those wedding bells ringing up upon that hill
And I don't wanna swallow such a bitter pill
You keep on moving and baby still
But I always loved you and I always will
I loved you and I see it still
But I always loved you and I always will
I loved you and I see it still
But I always loved you and I always will
If everything that went before didn't matter
I always loved you and I always will''''''''''''''
