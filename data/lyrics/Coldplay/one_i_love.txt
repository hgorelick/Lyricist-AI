Could you, could you come back? Come back together
Put yourself on the band and see us forever
Could you, could you come home? Come home forever
Surely things in the band keep us together

'Cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love
You're the one I love, ahhhh-ahhhh, ah

Could you, could you come home? Could you tell me whatever?
Tie yourself to a mast, it's now or it's never
Could it tear us apart? It'll soon be forever
It's gonna tear us apart, keep us together

You're the one I love, you're the one I love
Ahhh-ahhh, ah, you're the one I love, yeah-yeah, the one I love

Ooooh-oooh-ooooh-oh, ooooh-oooh-ooooh-oh
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

You're the one I love, you're the one I love, you're the one I love''''''''''''''''''
