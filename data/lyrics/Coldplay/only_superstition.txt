The cardboard head I see
Has found its way to me
It's old and it's old and it's old
Making me cry
I sleep but I will not move
I'm too scared to leave my room
But I won't be defeated, oh no

What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear
You say to me, "It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear
And the things from which you can't escape"

Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
Some numbers are better than others, oh no

What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear
You say to me, "It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear
And the things which you cannot explain"

And it's making me cry love
And it's making me cry
And I'm slipping away love
And I'm slipping away
It's only superstition, only your imagination
It's only superstition, only superstition''''''''''''''''''''''
