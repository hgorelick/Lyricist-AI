Been around the world
Wonders to view
Been around the world
Looking for someone like you
Pyramids shine, Babylon too!
But the beautifulest treasures lie in the deepest blue

So I'll never say die!
I'm never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is going to fight for you

Been around the world
Universe too...
I've been around flying, baby
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Dance with the stars
While I see the moon
I'll be standing there besides you
Right when the storm comes through

So I'll never say die!
I'm never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is going to fight for you
My army of one is going to fall for you, yeah...

'Cause you're right, cause you're right
'Cause you're right
My army of one is gonna call it through

Say my heart is my gun, army of one...
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one...
Is my only weapon, army of one
Say my heart is my gun, army of one...''''''''''''''
