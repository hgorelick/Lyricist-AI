Oh, when I get back on solid ground
I'm gonna crawl my way to you.

Oh, I once was lost and now I'm found
I'm gonna do what I should do,
and when I get back on my feet again
I'm gonna run my way to you.

Oh, when all is lost and come undone
I'm gonna sing out, and see ya through.
But no, the water,
the water flows over.

Oh, when I get back off my feet again,
I'm gonna crown my days a turn.

So all I've been on my knees again,
and I'll do it all the time.

And when I get back on solid ground
I'm gonna crawl my way to you.

Oh, I once was lost, but now I'm found,
so here's what I'm gonna do.

I sing, oh, the water,
the water flows over.
I sing, oh, the water,
the water flows over you.''''''''''''''
