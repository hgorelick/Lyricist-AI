Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
'Do you ever get the feeling that you're missing the mark?'
It's so cold it's so cold
It's so cold it's so cold
Written up in marker on a factory sign
'I struggle with the feeling that my life isn't mine'
It's so cold it's so cold
It's so cold it's so cold
See the arrow they shot
Trying to tear us apart
Take the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
Still I won't let go
Still I won't let go

Of you- ooh ooh
Cos you do
Oh you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

On every street every car every surface a name
Tonight the streets are ours
And we're writing and saying
Don't let em take control
No we won't let em take control
Yes I feel a little bit nervous
Yes I feel nervous and I cannot relax
How come they're out to get us
How come they're out when they don't know the facts
So on a concrete canvas under cover of dark
On a concrete canvas I'll go making my mark
Armed with a spraycan soul
I'll be armed with a spraycan soul
And you ooh ooh
You ooh ooh
Cos you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh
Yeah it's true
When you
Use your heart as a weapon
Then it hurts like heaven
And it hurts like heaven
Oh oh oh-oh

And it hurts like heaven
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh''''''''''''''''''
