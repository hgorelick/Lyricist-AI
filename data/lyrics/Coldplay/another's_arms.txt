Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Used to be your arms around me
Your body on my body

When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms
Another's arms
When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Is there someone there to reach me?
Or someone there to find me?

When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms
Another's arms
That's just torture to me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Pull yourself into me
Another's arms
Another's arms
When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Got to pull you close into me
Another's arms
Another's arms
Pull yourself right through me
Another's arms
Another's arms

Late night watching TV
Wish that you were here beside me
Wish that your arms were around me
Your body on my body''''''''''''''''''
