Here, I am
And beyond the reach of my hands
She's sound asleep
And she's sweet another know why
These dreams could've seen her
And I watched her slipping away
And I know I'll be hunting high and low
High...
There's no end to the lengths
I'll go too high and low
High...
There's no end to the lengths
I'll go too find her again
Upon this my dreams I depend
And, through the dark
I can hear the pounding of her heart
Next to mine
She's the sweetest love I could find
So I know I'll be hunting high and low
High...
There's no end to the lengths 
I'll go too high and low
High...
Do you know how it feels to love you?
Do you know how it feels to love you?
High and Low''''''''''''''
