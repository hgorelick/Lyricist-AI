Come on now, don't you want to see?
This thing that's happening to me
Like Moses has power over sea
So you've got power over me 

Come on now, don't you want to know?
You're a refuge, somewhere I can go
You're air that, air that I can breathe
Cause you're my golden opportunity 

And oh, oh yes I would
If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I
I wish 

Come on now, don't you want to see?
Just what a difference you've made in me
I'll be waiting oh no matter what you say
Cause I've been waiting for days, days, days 

And oh, oh yes I would
If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I
I wish
I wish 

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
If the sky's gonna fall down, let it fall on me
If you're gonna break down, you can break on me
If the sky's gonna fall down, let it fall on me
If it's gonna rain down, it can rain on me
It can rain on me''''''''''''''''
