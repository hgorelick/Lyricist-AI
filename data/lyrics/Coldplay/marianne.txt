Come on Marianne
The sun sets in your eyes
I'm in love again
Come on once or twice

Wanna be your air?
Come on now, all I see
Wanna ride along
Follow all our dreams

Kaleidoscopes that fall into the sun
Gonna lay the blame on me, not anyone
Gonna write a song
Sing it to the sun
Don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

Oh, sweet Marianne
You're the only one I've ever loved
And I swear it on
Swear it on the moon and stars above
I wanna understand
And, I wanna be your man
I wanna be your man
Swear it on the moon and stars

I will full moon
Just a part of me
Gonna write a song and see how a woman feel
Come on get it on right into the sun
Gonna ride along and fly, gonna let it on

Oh, sweet Marianne
You're the only one I've ever loved
And I swear it on
Swear it on the moon and stars above
In my head you're the only one I've ever loved
I wanna be your man
You're the only one I've ever loved

Oh, don't you love me
Oh, don't you love me
Don't you love me
Oh, don't you love me

Yeah yeah yeah
