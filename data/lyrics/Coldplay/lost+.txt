Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I've stopped
Doesn't mean I'm across

Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved
No better and no worse

I just got lost!
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along may come
A bigger one

And you'll be lost!
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the firing's stops
Oh and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

[Jay-Z]
Uh-huh
I got you
Uhh

With the same sword they knight you
They gon' good night you with
Shit, that's only half if they like you
That ain't even the half what they might do
Don't believe me, ask Michael

See Martin, see Malcolm
See Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus, see success is like suicide

Suicide, this is suicide
If you succeed, prepare to be crucified
Media meddles
Niggaz sue you, you settle
Every step you take, they remind you you ghetto
So it's tough being Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then, you have to be Bobby now

The question is, is to have had and lost
Better than not having it all
Because...

I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off
