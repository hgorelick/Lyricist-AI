In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost
Oh yeah 

I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost
Oh yeah 

Yeah
How long must you wait for it?
Yeah
How long must you pay for it?
Yeah
How long must you wait for it? 
Oh for it

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and under prepared
But I'll wait for it 

If you go, if you go
Leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you (yeah) 

Yeah
How long must you wait for it?
Yeah
How long must you pay for it?
Yeah
How long must you wait for it? 
Oh for it

Singing please, please, please
Come back and sing to me
To me, me
Come on and sing it out
Now, now
Come on and sing it out
To me, me 
Come back and sing 

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
Oh yeah.''''''''''''''''''''
