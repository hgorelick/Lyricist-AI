Once upon a time somebody ran, somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I've got to go, I've got to go
Once upon a time we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart, oh, oh, oh, oh

Once upon a time, we're burning bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight on and on, and on and on, and on

Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side in the same game
And why'd you have to go
Have to go and throw out all of my things?

I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle and worn a ring no, oh, you let me go
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle and worn a ring no, you let me go

You stole my star, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la la
You stole my star
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

'Cause you really hurt me, no, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me, oh no, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me, oh, you really hurt me
Oh, 'cause you really hurt me, oh, you really hurt me''''''''''''''''''
