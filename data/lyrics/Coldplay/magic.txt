Call it magic
Call it true
I call it magic
When I'm with you

And I just got broken
Broken into two
Still I call it magic
When I'm next to you

And I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

Call it magic
Cut me into two
And with all your magic
I disappear from view

And I can't get over
Can't get over you
Still I call it magic
You're such a precious jewel

And I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

Want to fall
I fall so far
I want to fall
I fall so hard

And I call it magic
And I call it true
I call it ma-ma-ma-magic

And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
"Still believe in magic?"
Well, yes, I do
Well, yes, I do
Well, yes, I do
Well, yes, I do
Of course I do''''''''''''''''''''
