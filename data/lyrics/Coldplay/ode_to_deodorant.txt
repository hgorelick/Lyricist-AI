Here's an Ode, ah, to deodorant
It's my thing, ah it's my favourite hygiene
It keeps me through the day

Another ode, ah to deodorant
It's my thing, ah it's my favourite hygiene
It's the confidence I need

It's medicine for the soul
It's medicine for the mind
It picks me up and makes me whole
It makes me feel alright

Here's an Ode, an ode to aerosol
It's my thing
Ah, it's my favourite hygiene, it's the confidence I need
It's medicine for the soul
It's medicine for the mind
It picks me up and makes me whole
It makes me feel alright

It's okay Oh, would I ever let you down? No way
Oh, would I ever let you down, okay?
Oh, would I ever let you down, no way
Oh, would I ever let you down...

I'll never let ya, I'll never let ya, I'll never let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way''''''''''''''
