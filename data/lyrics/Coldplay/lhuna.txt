I'm all by myself
I don't need anybody else
I'm all by myself
No help

I'm all on my own
Quietly sleeping in my home
I'm all on my own
My own

Hello
Won't you let me come in?
Lhuna
Can't you hear how much I'm suffering?
Hello
Won't you let me know?
'Cause I'm all alone
All alone

We are dreaming
About Lhuna
The smell of her
The touch and the taste of her
Dreaming
About Lhuna
Her and me
Simultaneously 

I don't know what the time is
I don't know where you've flown
And I don't know why you're so far
From home

Her and me
Effortlessly 
Oh, her and me
Effortlessly''''''''''''''
