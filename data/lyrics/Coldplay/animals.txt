Animals we are,
Disposable
Collapsible and raw
In you go,
Into some crowded room
And animals that climb
and they climbin' over you
Until you say
"Off you go, off you go"

Animal I am
and I'm lookin for an answer just like you
But I should know which way
to turn

An animal that runs
and I ran away from you
Because I'm scared
"Off you go, off you go"

But if you're gonna go, go now
And If you're gonna go, go now
I forgot to tell you how
so If you gonna go
go now

Animal you are,
Disposable, defenceless,
Yes I am
Watch your mouth,
Always watch your mouth,

An Animal that runs
And I made up my excuses
To you
And I missed my chance
By a stone's throw

And if you're gonna go, go now
If you're gonna go, go now
And I forgot to tell you how
So If you gonna go
Go now
Go now
Go now
Go now

I crumble,
Crumble and fall,
Crumble and fall,
Like an animal,

I crumble,
Crumble and fall,
Crumble and fall,
Like an animal,

Yes, I Crumble,
Crumble and fall,
Crumble and fall,
Like an animal,

Yes, I Crumble,
Crumble and fall,
Crumble and fall,
Like an animal''''''''''''''
