Been around the world
The wonders to view
Been around the world
Looking for someone like you
Pyramids try
Babylon too
But the beautifullest treasures lie in the deepest blue

So I never say die
Aim never untrue
Im never so high as when Im with you
And there isnt a fire that I wouldnt walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you

Been around the world
The universe too
Ive been around flying, baby
Its nothing I wouldnt do
Tanzaku stars
Lasso the moon
And be standing there beside you right
When the storm comes through

Cause I never say die
Aim never untrue
Never so high as when Im with you
And there isnt a fire
That I wouldnt walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you
My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah

Cause you reign
All cause you reign
All cause you reign
My army of one is gonna call it through
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
Its my only weapon, army of one
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one

(So I reach for it)

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
My heart go boom, bo-boom boom
Stare into darkness, admit defeat
Coming home and I'm finding no peace

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm out of luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know what you've got

I put my hands up to the sky, feeling like
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
Put my hands up to the sky, it's alright
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I reach for it) Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it)

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
You make my heart go boom, bo-boom boom
Superhero, a masterpiece
Been innocent but a sinner in me

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm in luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know when I'm not

I just put my hands up to the sky, feeling like
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
Put my hands up to the sky, it's alright
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I just put my hands up to the sky, feeling like
I've got a rocket, eyes on the prize
I put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I reach for it) Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it) Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it) And I know, and I know, and I know
(So I reach for it) I know what I've got
