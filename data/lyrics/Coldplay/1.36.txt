Stuck in a corner 
are monkeys in cages 
that don't have a number 
to fight one another 
try to recover 

Climb up the ladder 
look up and you see birds 
blind as each other 
how long can we suffer? 
we're as blind as each other 

On the cloud that you're sitting 
there's one born every minute 
so much to discover 
I've become a believer 

Sisters and brothers 
who fight one another 
will mourn and deceive us 
will find us and keep us 
take us or leave us 

How soon is now? yeah 
how long is never? 
I'm nothing but normal 
with something together 
come on stick together 

On the cloud that you're sitting 
there's one born every minute 
so much to discover 
I've become a believer''''''''''''''''''
