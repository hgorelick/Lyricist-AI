Oh no, I see
A spider web, it's tangled up with me
And I lost my head
The thought of all the stupid things I'd said
Oh no, what's this?
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
The thought of all the stupid things I'd done

I never meant to cause you trouble
I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm

Oh no, I see
A spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
Here am I in my little bubble

Singing I never meant to cause you trouble
I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me''''''''''''''''''
