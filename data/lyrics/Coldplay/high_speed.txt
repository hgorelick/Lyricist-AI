Can anybody fly this thing?
Before my head explodes, before my head starts to ring
We've been living life inside a bubble
We've been living life inside a bubble

Confidence in you, is confidence in me
Is confidence in high speed

Can anybody stop this thing?
Before my head explodes, before my head starts to ring
We've been living life inside a bubble
We've been living life inside a bubble

Confidence in you, is confidence in me
Is confidence in high speed, in high speed

In high speed, you want, high speed, you want
High speed, you want, high speed''''''''''''''''''
