All winter, we got carried
Away over on the rooftops, let's get married
All summer, we just hurried
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
So come over, just be patient and don't worry

So come over, just be patient and don't worry
And don't worry

No, I don't wanna battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't wanna follow Death and all of his friends

No, I don't want to battle from beginning to end
