There's a wild wind blowing
Down the corner of my street
Every night there the headlights are glowing

There's a cold war coming
On the radio I heard
Baby it's a violent world

Oh love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow
I can hear it coming
I can hear the siren sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Time came a-creeping
Oh and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes o-o-o-on
Time'll leak and lead you on
Still it's such a beautiful night

Oh oh love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow
I can hear it coming
Like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Gravity release me
And don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground''''''''''''''''''''
