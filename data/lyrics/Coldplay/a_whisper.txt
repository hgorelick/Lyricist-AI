A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Remember your face and remember too
When you are wrong

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me
When I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Night turns to day
And I still have these questions
Please just refrain
Should I go forwards or backwards
Night turns to day
And I still can't go back to you

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Remember your face and remember too
When you are wrong

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me
When I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper''''''''''''''''
