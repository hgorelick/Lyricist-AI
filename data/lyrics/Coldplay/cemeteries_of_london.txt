At night they would go walking
'Til the breaking of the day
The morning is for sleeping
Through the dark streets they go searching
To see God in their own way
Save the night time for your weeping
Your weeping

Singing lalalalalalalalaiy
And the night over London lay

So we rode down to the river
Where Victorian ghosts pray
For their curses to be broken
We go underneath the arches
Where the witches are and they say
There are ghost towns in the ocean
The ocean

Singing lalalalalalalalaiy
And the night over London lay

God is in the houses
And God is in my head
And all the cemeteries of London
I see God come in my garden
But I don't know what He said
For my heart, it wasn't open
Not open

Singing lalalalalalalalaiy
And the night over London lay

Singing lalalalalalalalaiy
There's no light over London today''''''''''''''''''''
