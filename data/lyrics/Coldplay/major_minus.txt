They got one eye watching you, one eye on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to
They got one eye watching you, one eye on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do
And be careful when you're walking into view
Just be careful when you're walking into view

Oo-oo, oo-oo
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Oo-oo, oo-oo
Got one eye on the road and one on you

They got one eye watching you, one eye on what you do
So be careful cause nothing they say is true
No d-don't believe a word, it's just us against the world
And we just got to turn up to be heard
Hear the crocodiles ticking 'round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking 'round the world

Oo-oo, oo-oo
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Oo-oo, oo-oo
Got one eye on the road and one on you
You could hear them climbing the stairs
I got my right side fighting while my left hides under the chairs

Ah
Ah

Oo-oo, oo-oo
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Oo-oo, oo-oo
Got one eye on the road and one on you''''''''''''''''
