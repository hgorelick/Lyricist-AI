Oooooh, eeh!
Oooooh, eeh, oooh!
Ooooh, eh!

So we left La Mancha, 
Headed out for higher plains
Me and Sancho Panza

Looking for adventure,
Rosinante at the reigns,
To the windmills answer,

You'll never be lonely
You'll never be loney ever again

You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely again.

I heard you never get wet in Spanish Rain

So they sent the doctor
For examining my brain

Said : "He's not too clever"

When the world, when the world just seems
A little bit too cruel
Gonna leave it better
Make one better . Hey!

So tell that princess
Tell that princess right down the train
Tell that princess : She'll never be lonely again

I heard you never get wet in Spanish Rain

Ooooh, eh!
Oooooh, eh, oo-oh....
Oooooh eh

I heard you never get wet in Spanish Rain...''''''''''''''
