You see the world in black and white, no colour or light
You think you'll never get it right but you're wrong, you might
The sky could fall, could fall on me, the parting of the sea
But you mean more, mean more to me than any colour I can see

All you ever wanted was love but you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up as us

You see the world in black and white, not painted bright
You see no meaning to your life, you should try, you should try

All you ever wanted was love but you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up
Don't you want to see it come soon floating in a big white balloon
Come give her your own silver spoon
Don't you want to see it come down, there for throwing your arms around
And say "You're not a moment too soon"

'Cause I feel low, 'cause I feel low, ooooh...
Yeah I feel low, oh no, oooh...
Ooooh, 'cause I feel low (aah), 'cause I feel low, ooooh...
Yeah I feel low, oh no, oooh...''''''''''''''''''
