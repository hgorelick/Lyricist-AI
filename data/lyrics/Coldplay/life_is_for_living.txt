Now, I never meant to do you wrong
And that's what I came here to say
That if I was wrong then I'm sorry
But don't let it stand in our way

'Cause my head just aches when I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done
But life is for living, we all know 
And I don't wanna live it alone

Sing ah, ah, oh
Sing ah, ah, oh
And just think ah, ah, oh''''''''''''''''''
