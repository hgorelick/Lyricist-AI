I awake to find no peace of mind
I said how do you live
As a fugitive?
Down here, where I cannot see so clear
I said what do I know?
Show me the right way to go

And the spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
And the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them, no 
'Cause they're all spies

They're all spies

I awake to see that no one is free
We're all fugitives, look at the way we live
Down here, I cannot sleep from fear, no
I said which way do I turn?
Oh I forget everything I learn

Spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
And the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them, no
'Cause they're all spies

They're all spies

And if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us
And if we don't hide now
They're gonna catch us when we sleep
Oh, And if we don't hide here 
They're gonna find us

Spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so good 'cause you know
But those spies hide out in every corner
They can't touch you, no
'Cause they're just spies

They're just spies
They're just spies 
They're just spies
They're just spies''''''''''''''''''
