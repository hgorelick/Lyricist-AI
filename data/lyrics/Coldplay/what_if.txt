What if there was no light
Nothing wrong, nothing right
What if there was no time?
And no reason or rhyme?
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?

What if I got it wrong
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?

Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try?
Ooh, that's right

Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
But that's the risk that you take
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life?
That you don't want me there by your side?

Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
How can you know it when you don't even try?
Ooh, that's right

Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
You know that darkness always turns into light
Ooh, that's right''''''''''''''''''''''
