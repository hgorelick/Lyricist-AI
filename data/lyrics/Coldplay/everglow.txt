Oh they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial

Like a lion you ran,  a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled, in perfect purple
So how come things move on, how come cars dont slow
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should but I cant let you go?

But when Im cold, cold
Oh when Im cold, cold
Theres a light that you give me when Im in shadow
Theres a feeling you give me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night wed be friends til we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now Im gonna miss you I know

But when Im cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that youre with me and the way you will show
And youre with me wherever I go
And you give me this feeling this everglow

Oh- I I I I
What I wouldnt give for just a moment to hold
Yeah I live for this feeling this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh the light that you left me will everglow''''''''''''''
