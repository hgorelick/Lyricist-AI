Wait for your call, love
The call never came
Ready to fall up
Ready to claim
I'm ready for it all, love
Ready for the pain
Meet under sun and
Meet me again
In the rain
In the rain

Behind the walls, love
I'm trying to change
And I'm ready for it all, love
I'm ready for a change
Meet me in blue sky
And meet me again
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain

You've got to find yourself alone in this world
You've got to find yourself alone''''''''''''''''
