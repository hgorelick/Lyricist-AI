Lord, I don't know which way I am going
Which way the river's going to flow
It just seems that upstream I keep rowing
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

And that light hits your eyes
I know I swear we find somewhere
The streets are paved with gold
Bullets fly, split the sky
But that's all right, sometimes sunlight
Comes streaming through the holes

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh''''''''''''''''
