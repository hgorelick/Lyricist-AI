So it's over
This time I know it's gone
Salt water
Tasted it too long
I only know I'm wrong
Now, I know it's gone

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone

So it's over
This time you're flying on
This time I know no song
Can stop it's slowly burn
Can stop it's slowly gone

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone
We have slowly gone
Can't we pour some water on?''''''''''''''''
