She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came down
Gets colder day by day, I miss her

I hear children singin'
It felt like Christmas time

In these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle

And our hearts were singin'
It felt like Christmas time

2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go

She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came falling now
Gets colder day by day, I miss you

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time''''''''''''''''
