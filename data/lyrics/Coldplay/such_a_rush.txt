Such a rush to do nothing at all
Such a fuss to do nothing at all
Such a rush to do nothing at all

Such a rush to get nowhere at all
Such a fuss to do nothing at all
Such a rush

And it's just like you said
It's just like you'll say

Such a rush to do nothing at all
Such a fuss to get nowhere at all
Such a rush, such a rush

And it's just like you said
It's just like you'll say

So slow down please
Just slow down
So slow down please
Just slow down

Looking at a paper
Going after money
Far too many people 
Looking for their money
Everybody's out there 
Trying to get money
Why can't you just tell me?
Trying to get money rush

Such a rush
No rush
Such a rush

Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush''''''''''''''''
