They're calling you
Some kind of ghost
But I know that's not true

Cause time and time again I spoke
And I have spoke with you

They're saying I 
Am some kind of ghost
But that's so hard to say

Maybe I'll go
Maybe you're safe

No there's no way to say...

And I would love you
To come over
And I would love you
Too''''''''''''''
