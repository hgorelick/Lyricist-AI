My song is love
 My song is love, unknown
 And it goes up
 You don't have to be alone

 My heavy heart
 Looks like it's made of stone
 But it's so hard to see, clearly
 You don't have to be on your own
 You don't have to be on your own

 And I'm not gonna take it back
 Oh I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
 You're the target that I'm aiming at
 And I'm not singing on my own

 That bitter breathe
 That bitter breathe has blown
 Left me on fire, for you, clearly
 Taken everything and gone
 Its taken everything I own

 But I'm not gonna take it back
 Im not gonna say I dont mean that
 You're the target that I'm aiming at
 And I'm nothing on my own
 Got to get that message home

 I'm not gonna stand and wait
 Not gonna leave it until it's much too late
 On a platform I'm gonna stand and say
 Oh I'm nothing on my own
 Till that bitter breathe has blown

 My song is love, Is love unknown
 And Ive got to get that message home''''''''''''''
