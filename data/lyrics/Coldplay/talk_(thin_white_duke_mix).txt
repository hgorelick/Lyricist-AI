computer voice:  R-E-M-I-X

Oh, brother I can't, I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you 
Cause I don't know what to do
Oh, brother I can't believe it's true (believe it's true)
I'm so scared about the future 
And I wanna talk to you

computer voice:  Now talk baby!
computer chant:  Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...

You could take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done

computer voice:  Now talk baby!
computer chant:  Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...

Are you lost or incomplete
Do you feel like a puzzle
You can't find your missing piece
Tell me how you feel
How you feel
How you feel
How you feel

So you take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung, or do 
Something that's never been done

computer chant:  Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...

computer voice:  Now talk baby!

How you feel
How you feel (how you feel)
How you feel...
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk...

So you don't know where you're going but you wanna talk
You'll tell anyone who'll listen but you feel ignored
When you worry about the future or the third world war
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk...

computer chant:  Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...''''''''''''''''
