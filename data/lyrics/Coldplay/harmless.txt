If you call and call
Your self esteem is low
And I heard you'd called
Is there no calling?
And away I go
Any way you go
I was on your tail
As clear as crystal

But it was harmless
It couldn't hurt you
Oh you were helpless
I know you'll get through
I know, I

Chemicals are cold
See you sit down on
A chemical you cause
Is like a crystal
So I heard you say
I got to get away
I'm on a second trail
As clear as crystal

But I was harmless
It couldn't hurt you
Oh you were helpless
I know you'll get through''''''''''''''''
