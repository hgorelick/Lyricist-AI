For a second I was in control
I had it once, I lost it though
And all along the fire below would rise

And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now, you let me go
But one last time

Tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me

Remember once upon a time
When I was yours and you were blind
The fire would sparkle in your eyes
And mine

So tell me you love me
And if you don't then lie
Lie to me

Just tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
If you don't then lie
Oh, lie to me

And call it true, call it true love
Call it true, call it true love''''''''''''''''''
