Oh You only live twice or so they say
One life for yourself one for the rest

And you, You drift through the years and life seems strange,
And one dream appears and love is its name.

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on,
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone.

Oh you, you only live twice or so it seems
One life for yourself, one for your dreams

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on,
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone, gone, gone''''''''''''''
