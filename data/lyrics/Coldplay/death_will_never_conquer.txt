If sweet Death should ever conquer me
Let me know, boys, let me know
If you hear him coming, won't you let me flee?
Let me go, boys, let me go

One day Death is going to conquer me
I'll be down where the waters flow
I hope sweet Heaven has a place for me
Let me know, boys, let me know

If sweet Death should ever conquer me
Take me down to some place below
If you hear him coming, won't you set me free?
Let me go, boys, let me go
If you hear him coming, won't you say for me
That I just don't want to go''''''''''''''''''
