Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, Up and up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, Up and up

See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, Up and up

Were gonna get it, get it together
I know were gonna get it, get it together somehow
Were gonna get it, get it together and flower

Were gonna get it, get it together
I know, were gonna get it, get it together and float
Were gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up

How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people
Break your heart? Break your heart?

Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to
Heal it up, heal it up

See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, Just need love
When the going is rough, saying

Were gonna get it, get it together
I know were gonna get it, get it together somehow
Were gonna get it, get it together and flower

Were gonna get it, get it together
I know, were gonna get it, get it together and float
Were gonna get it, get it together and go

And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say its mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

Were gonna get it, get it together
I know were gonna get it, get it together somehow
Were gonna get it, get it together and flower

Were gonna get it, get it together
I know, were gonna get it, get it together and float
Were gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and

Were gonna get it, get it together
I know were gonna get it, get it together somehow
Were gonna get it, get it together and flower

Were gonna get it, get it together
I know, were gonna get it, get it together and float
Were gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When youre in pain, when you think youve had enough
Dont ever give up
Dont ever give up

Believe in love''''''''''''''
