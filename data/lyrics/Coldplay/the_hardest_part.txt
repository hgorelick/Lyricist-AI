And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part

And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet, I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh

And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part, oh, oh

I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
Oh, and I
I wonder what it's all about

I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

Oh, and that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah, that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part''''''''''''''''''''
