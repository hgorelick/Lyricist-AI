Are you missing something?
Looking for something?
Tired of everything?
Searching and struggling?
Are you worried about it?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Oh you're gonna get it right sometime

There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
Are you running in a circle?
You can't be too careful
And you can't relate it
'Cause it's complicated
Oh you're gonna get it right sometime
You're gonna get it right sometime

That's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you heard?
That's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna get hurt
Ooooooooooh

Is there something missing?
Is nobody listening?
Are you scared of what you don't know?
Don't wanna end up on your own
You need conversation
And information
Oh you're gonna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
But you can't believe a word?
That's how you see the world
Oh don't you worry yourself
'Cause nobody can hurt
Youooooooooooh
Oooooooooooooh
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooh

That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world''''''''''''''''
