Stuck here in the middle of nowhere
With a headache and a heavy heart
Oh well nothing was going quite right here
and I'm tired, I can't play my part

Come on, come on
Oh what a state I'm in
Come on, come on,
Why won't it just sink in
Help is just around the corner for us

Oh my head just won't stop achin'
I'm sat here lickin' my wounds
I'm shattered but it really doesn't matter
Cos my rescue is gonna be here soon

Come on, come on
Oh what a state I'm in
Come on, come on,
Why won't it just sink in
Help is just around the corner for us
Help is just around the corner for us
Oh help is just around the corner for us''''''''''''''''
