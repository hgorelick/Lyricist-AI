As far as I can see
All time and circuitry
Is wrong

As far as poetry
Sit down and sing to me
A song

'Cause all I want in this world
All I want in this world
Is for you to come home

A spell
A rebel yell
A spell

Soldier, come home to me
You've been away from me
So long

All I want in this world
All I want and deserve
Is for you to come home

A spell
A rebel yell
A spell
A rebel yell
A spell
A rebel yell
A spell
A rebel yell

A spell
A rebel yell
A spell
A rebel yell
A spell (a spell)
A rebel yell
A spell
A rebel yell (a rebel yell)''''''''''''''
