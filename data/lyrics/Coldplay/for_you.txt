If you're lost and feel alone, circumnavigate the globe
All you ever have to hope for too
And the way you seem to flow, circumnavigate in hope
And they seem to lose control with you

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Everyone of us is hurt and everyone of us is scarred
Everyone of us is scared, not you
Yeah, your eyes closed, your head hurts
Your eyes feel so low

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Everyone of us is scared, everyone of us is hurt
Everyone of us has hope for you, for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you''''''''''''''''
