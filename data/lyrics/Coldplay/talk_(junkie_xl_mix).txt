Oh Brother I Can't, I Can't Get Through
I've Been Trying Hard To Reach You 'Cause I Don't Know What To Do
Oh Brother I Can't Believe It's True
I'm So Scared About The Future And I Wanna Talk To You

..

So You Take A Picture Of Something You See
Or Swim A River After The Sea
You Can Climb A Ladder Up To The Sun
Or Write A Song Nobody Has Sung Or Do
Something That's Never Been Done, Do

So You Don't Know Where You're Going But You Want To Talk
You'll Tell Anyone Who'll Listen But You Feel Ignored
When You Worry About The Future Or The Third World War
And You Feel Like You're Going Where You've Been Before
Let's Talk, Let's Talk

So You Take A Picture Of Something You See
Or Swim A River After The Sea
You Can Climb A Ladder Up To The Sun
Or Write A Song Nobody Has Sung Or Do
Something That's Never Been Done, Do

Let's Talk
Let's Talk
Let's Talk
Let's Talk''''''''''''''
