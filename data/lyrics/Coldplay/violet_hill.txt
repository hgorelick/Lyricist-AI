Was a long and dark December; from the rooftops I remember
There was snow; white snow
Clearly I remember, from the windows they were watching
While we froze, down below
When the future's architectured by a carnival of idiots
On show, you'd better lie low
If you love me, won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December, when the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles, hollowed out to fit their rifles
And the cross was held aloft
Bury me in armour; when I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze
And if you love me, won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier, who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below
So if you love me, why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to Violet Hill; there we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?''''''''''''''''''''
