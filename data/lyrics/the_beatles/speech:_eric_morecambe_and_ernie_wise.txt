Ernie Wise: Did you enjoy that, boys? Now boys, what I was thinking was, er... would you like to do a number with us, you know, we'd like to do a number together.
Beatles: Yeah, oh yes, great!
Eric Morecambe: Hey eh! It's the Kay Sisters, they've come! Great! Fabulous!
E.W: They're not the Kay Sisters, this is the...
E.M. I'm glad you've dyed your hair!
E.W. This is The Beatles!
E.M. Hello, Beetle!
George: Hello.
E.M. Where is he?
E.W. Where is he?
E.M. There he is, hello, Bongo!
E.W. That's Ringo!
E.M. Oh, is he that as well, oh by Golly!
E.W. As you can gather, this is Eric. Say hello to Eric.
Paul: Hello, Eric.
E.M. Hello, mate.
Paul: I remember you. You're the one with the short, fat, hairy legs!
E.M. No no no, he's the one with the short, fat, hairy legs!
E.W. Yeah.
E.M. No, him.
E.W. Yeah.
George: We're the one's with the big, fat, hairy heads! Get out of that!
E.M. Eh! What's it like being famous?
John: Well, it's not like in your day, y'know.
E.W. What?
E.M. That's an insult!
E.W. You didn't expect that, did you?"
E.M. No! What do you mean, not like in my day?
John: Oh, my dad used to tell me about you, y'know.
E.W. In the old days?
E.M. You've still got a little dad, have you? His dad used to tell him, it's a bit strong isn't?
E.W. No, he's right!
E.M. All right, Bonzo!
E.W. Bonzo?! That's Ringo!
E.M. Yeah, him as well... get them off, they've done enough.
E.W. What do you mean, done enough?
E.M. No well, I'm getting insulted now. Get off!!
E.W. No, what I was going to suggest was let's do a number with the boys.
E.M. Oh yes, one that their dad'll remember, that I used to do with your dad!
E.W. You go and get changed.
E.M. Yes, I will, right.
E.W. What do you think we should do, boys? What about... er... something that's more suitable for Eric's age.
John: Moonlight Bay.
E.W. Moonlight Bay?!
John: Yeah.
E.W. So, Ladies and Gentlemen, we're going to make history on television. For the first time we have Morecambe and Wise and the Beatles presenting to you that wonderful old fashioned number Moonlight Bay. You all remember the number? Ok, fellas, that's great. You look marvellous. Are you ready?
John: Aye!
E.W. All right, we'll take it from the top. Ok, Ken, thank you.
