Chains
My baby's got me locked up in chain
And they ain't the kind
That you can see
Oh-oh, these chains of love
Got a hold on me, yeah

Chain
Well, I can't break away from these chain
Can't run around
'Cause I'm not free
Oh-oh, these chains of love
Won't let me be, yeah

I wanna tell you, pretty baby
I think you're fine
I'd like to love you
But, darling, I'm imprisoned by these

Chain
My baby's got me locked up in chain
And they ain't the kind
That you can see
Oh-oh, these chains of love
Got a hold on me, yeah

Please believe me when I tell you
Your lips are sweet
I'd like to kiss them
But I can't break away from all of these

Chain
My baby's got me locked up in chain
And they ain't the kind
That you can see
Oh-oh, these chains of love
Got a hold on me, yeah

Chains
Chains of love
Chains of love
Chains of love
