don't care if I spent my dough 
night gonna be (...) 

Gonna rock it up, 
gonna shake it up, 
gonna roll it up, 
have 'em ball tonight. 

Rattle and roll, 
I said shake rattle and roll, 
Well you never done nothing 
to save your doggone soul. 

Well get out of that kitchen 
and shake those pots and pans. 
I said get out of that kitchen 
and shake those pots and pans. 
I said to my soul: 
you're the devil in a frying pan. 

Well I said shake rattle and roll, 
I said shake rattle and roll, 
I said shake rattle and roll, 
I said shake rattle and roll. 
Well you never done nothing 
to save your doggone soul. 

You can knock me down, 
slap my face, 
slander my name 
all over the place. 
Do anything that you want to do, 
but oh oh honey, 
lay off of them shoes. 

Now don't you step 
on my blue suede shoes. 
Well you can do anything 
but lay off of them blue suede shoes. 

Ah go! 

You can burn my house, 
steal my car, 
drink my liquor 
from an old fruit jar. 
Do anything 
that you want to do, 
but ah ah honey, 
lay off of them shoes. 

And don't you step 
on my blue suede shoes, please. 
Well you can do anything 
but lay off of them blue suede shoes. 

Ah go, hit it, Carl (Perkins)! 

Well blue blue, 
blue suede shoes. 
Yeah blue blue, 
blue suede shoes. 
Babe blue blue, 
blue suede shoes. 
Yeah brown brown 
brown suede boots. 
Well do anything 
but lay off of them blue suede shoes.
