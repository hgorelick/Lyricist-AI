(Cool man. What? Can we do 'Blue Moon Of Kentucky?'

What?)

Well blue moon
(No?

Yeah, it's got the chords that was opening.

Here right!)

Well blue moon

(Just a short version.)

Blue moon, blue moon
Keep on shining bright
Blue moon, keep on shining bright
My baby back tonight
Blue moon, keep on shining bright

I said blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well blue moon of Kentucky
Just keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

Well, it was on one moonlight night
With the stars shining bright
Wish blown high
Love said goodbye

Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

(Ha ha ha!)
