Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
For the sake of auld lang syne?
For the sake of auld lang syne, my dear?
For the sake of auld lang syne?
For the sake of auld lang syne, my dear?
For the sake of auld lang syne?

One, one, two, three...

(P): Well, for the sake of Auld Lang Syne. That reminds me, Ringo.

(R): Yes.

(P): Last year...

(R): You was here.

(P): We was here. Round the same old mic. Same old studio.

(R): Same old guitars. Same old faces.

(J): (Singing)
It's the same old song,
But a different meaning since...

(G): Copyright, Johnny!

(R): Copyright. Can't say that.

(P): Hey, yeah! All right. What are we gonna do without a copyright, yeah?

(J): How about "We'll get the Lilacs and an Old Brown Shoe"?

(R): Yeah, yes. That has a copyright.

(J): Alright, let's play a request...

(P): Something Christmassy...

(J)...for all the boys in B.A.O.R.E.

(P): Yeah, alright.

(R): What shall we play for them? 'cause we got some fans in the forces, you know.

(J): Well, here in Munich, it's not quite as fine as it is in London.

(R): Well, Kenneth, the weather's raining here, it's not very good.

(J): Well it's not bad over here, but summer, you know, we had a bit of rain and all that. 

(R): Stay tuned in, it's a five-way link-up.

(J): If you've enjoyed this program, tune to 29314567 megacycles. If you can't find that, drop it!

(All): (Singing)
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind? China!
Don in Vietnam and China...too...
And look at all those bodies Jordan
Floating in the River Jordan.

(P): Well, that looks as though it's about it for the year.

(R): Well, that should cover Israel.

(P): We've certainly tried our best to, ah...

(R): Please everybody.

(P): ... please everybody. If we haven't done what we could've done. We've tried.

(J): And if you haven't got yours, send four pence in and get a free one!

(G): And seeing as (*since?) we're gathered around the Christmas microphone here in the studio, we might as well get together with a little Christmas message for you.

(P): Which goes something like this...

(G): ... like this.

(J): (Singing)
Christmas comes but once a year
But when it does, you know it's here,
Because we've got a hmm-mm-mm-aam-
Singing

Christmas comes but once a year
But when it does it brings good cheer,
Because we've got the hmm-mm-mm-aam -
For Christmas.
