The leaves of brown 
Came tumbling down, 
Remember in September in the rain. 
The sun went out 
Just like a light, 
Remember in September in the rain. 

To every word 
Of love I heard you whisper 
The raindrops seems 
To play a sweet refrain. 

Thought it's spring, 
To me it's still September, 
Oh that September in the rain. 

To every word

The raindrops seems 
To play a sweet refrain. 
Thought it's spring, 
To me it's still September, 
Oh that September in the rain. 
I said I said it's September in the rain. 
Ah September in the rain.
