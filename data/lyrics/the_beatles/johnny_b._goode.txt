Deep down in Louisianna 
Close to New Orleans, 
Way back up in the woods 
Among the evergreens, 
There stand a country cabin 
Made of clay and wood, 
Where lives a young country boy 
Named Johnny B.Goode, 
He never ever learned 
To read or write a book so well, 
But he could play his guitar 
Just like a-ringing a bell. 

Go go, go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Aah Johnny B.Goode! 

He used to carry his guitar 
In a gunny sack, 
Sit beneath the trees 
By the railroad track. 
Oh sitting and a-playing 
In the shade, 
Drumming to the rhythm 
That the drivers made. 
People passing by 
Used to stop and say: 
My oh my, 
That country boy can play. 

Go go, go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Aah Johnny B.Goode! 

Well his mama told him: 
Someday you will be a man. 
And you will be the leader 
Of a big old band. 
Many people coming 
From miles around, 
To hear you play your music 
Till the sun goes down. 
Maybe some day 
Your name will be in light, 
Saying: Johnny 
B. Goode tonight! 

Go go, go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Aah Johnny B.Goode!
