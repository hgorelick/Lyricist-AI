Please don't wake me up too late
Tomorrow comes and I will not be late
Late today when it becomes tomorrow
I will leave and go away

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love goodbye

Songs that linger on my lips
Excite me now and linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door
I leave them for the one who waits behind

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love goodbye

Far away my lover sings
A lonely song and calls me to his side
Where the sound of lonely drums
Invited me on, I must be by his side

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love goodbye

Goodbye
Ah, ha, ha, ha
Bye, bye
