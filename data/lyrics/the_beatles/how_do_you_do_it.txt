How do you do 
What you do to me? 
I wish I knew, 
If I knew how you do it to me 
I'd do it to you. 

How do you do 
What you do to me? 
I'm feeling blue, 
Wish I knew how you do it to me 
But I haven't a clue. 

You give me a feeling in my heart, 
Like an arrow piercing through it. 
I suppose that you think you're very smart, 
But won't you tell me how do you do it?
