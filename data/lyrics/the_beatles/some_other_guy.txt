Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken away my sweet desire, oh now
Some other guy now, I just don't wanna hold my hand, oh now
I'm the lonely one
As long as I can feel all right

Some other guy is sippin' up the honey like a yellow dog, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love just like I'm gone, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
I'm the lonely one
As long as I can feel all right
Wo wo wo wo

Some other guy now, is makin' me very very mad, oh now
Some other guy now, is makin' my past seem oh so bad, oh now
Some othe guy now, she was the first girl I ever had, oh now
I'm the lonely one
As long as I can feel all right
Wo wo wo wo

I'm a-talkin' to you, right now, hey! Ow!
