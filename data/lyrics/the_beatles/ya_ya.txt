Oh, well, I'm sittin' here, la, la,
Waiting for my ya ya,
Uh huh, uh huh.
Er, sittin' here, la, la,
Waiting for my ya ya,
Uh huh, uh huh.
It may sound funny,
But I don't believe she's comin',
Uh huh, uh huh.

Baby, honey, don't leave me worried,
Uh huh, uh huh.
Er, baby, honey, er, don't leave me worried,
Uh huh, uh huh.
You know that I love you.
Oh, how I love you,
Uh huh, uh huh.
