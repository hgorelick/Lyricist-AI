Rodney Burke: Now, for the final number, John's got a card in his hand with a little rhyme on it. What is it?
John: It's from the form up a third at Hemel Hempstead.
Rodney: Oh!
John: It says:
Dear George, John, Ringo, Paul, here's hoping that you'll please us all
A beauty song and swinging voice, we leave it up to you, the choice
We think you're fab and really cool, so brighten up our lives at school.John: Dig this, for here's Paul, whistling Clarabella.
