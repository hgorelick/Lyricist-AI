I told you 'bout Strawberry Fields 
You know, the place where nothing is real
Well, here's another place you can go-o
Where everything flo-ows
Looking through the bent-backed tulips
To see how the other half live 
Looking through a glass onion 

I told you 'bout the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man 
Well, here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul 
Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah 
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah 
Looking through a glass onion 

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Looking through a glass onion 

I told you 'bout the fool on the hill
I tell you, man, he living there still
Well, here's another place you can be
Listen to me 
Fixin' the hole in the ocean 
Tryin' to make a dovetail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion
