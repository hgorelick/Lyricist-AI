One, two, three

Hey baby, won't you take a chance?
Say that you'll let me have this dance

Let's dance, come on, let's dance
Do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
Come on, come on, let's dance

Hey baby, woh, you thrill me so
Hold me tight, don't let me go

Hey hey, hey, come on, let's dance
Do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
Come on, hey, come on, let's twist, alright

Hey, baby, if you're all alone
Maybe you'll let me walk you home

Hey, hey, come on, let's dance
Do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
Come on, hey, come on, let's dance

Hey, baby, things are swinging right
Yes, I know that tonight's the night

Come on, hey, come on, let's dance, oh
Do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old thing that you wanna do
Come on, oh come on, let's dance

Hey, let's dance, come on, let's dance
Come on, hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
Come on, oh yeah, oh yeah
