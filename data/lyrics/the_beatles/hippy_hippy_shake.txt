For goodness sake, 
I've got the hippy hippy shake. 
I've got the shake, 
Oh the hippy hippy shake. 

Oo I can't keep still 
With the hippy hippy shake. 
I get my fill 
With that hippy hippy shake. 
Oo my babe, 
Auw the hippy hippy shake. 

Well now you shake it to the left, 
You shake it to the right. 
Do the hippy shake shake 
With all of your might. 
And you shake. 
Oh you shake. 
Oo my babe. 
Auw the hippy hippy shake. 

Well now you shake it to the left, 
You shake it to the right. 
Do the hippy shake shake 
With all of your might. 
And you shake. 
Yes you shake. 
Oo my babe. 
Auw the hippy hippy shake. 
Au the hippy hippy shake. 
Yeah the hippy hippy shake. 
Oh yeah.
