I love you
'Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true
That it really only goes to show
That I know that I
Should never, never, never be blue

Now you're mine
My happiness, dear, makes me cry
And in time
You'll understand the reason why
If I cry, it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

I can't believe
It's happened to me
I can't conceive
Of any more 
Misery

Ask me why
I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

I love you
'Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true
That it really only goes to show
That I know that I
Should never, never, never be blue

Ask me why
I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

I can't believe
It's happened to me
I can't conceive
Of any more 
Misery

Ask me why
I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you
You
You
