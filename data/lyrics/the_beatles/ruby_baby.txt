I said I love a girl and Ruby is her name
This girl don't love me, but I love her just the same
Oh, oh, Ruby, Ruby, how I want ya
Like a ghost I'm gonna haunt ya
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, will you be mine sometime?

Well, each time I see you waving my heart cries
I'll tell ya, I'm gonna steal you away from all those guys
Oh, oh, from the happy day I met you
I made a bet that I was going to get you
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, will you be mine sometime?
Alright now

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I said I love a girl and Ruby is her name
Oh, when this girl looks at me she just sets my heart aflame, oh
Oh, I got some love and money too
I'm gonna give them all to you
Now, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, will you be mine sometime?
Come on, Ruby, baby, now, hey

Hey, hey, hey, hey
