I'm just sitting here reminiscing
Wondering who you've been kissing, baby, oh oh baby
I've been wandering all around
There must be a new guy in town

You don't love me anymore
I'll get over you baby
Although my heart's still sore
You know my heart's still sore

Well, I think of all the lies you told
You're a junk man, my heart you sold
You're a cheater and a mean mis treater
When I think of all the fun we had

Kind of makes me feel so sad
And I'm lonely for your love and as long as I live
It's only you I'll be thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of
