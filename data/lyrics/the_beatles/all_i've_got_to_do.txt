Whenever I want you around, yeah
All I gotta do
Is call you on the phone
And you'll come running home
Yeah, that's all I gotta do

And when I, I wanna kiss you, yeah
All I gotta do
Is whisper in your ear
The words you long to hear
And I'll be kissing you

And the same goes for me
Whenever you want me at all
I'll be here, yes, I will
Whenever you call
You just gotta call on me, yeah
You just gotta call on me

And when I, I wanna kiss you, yeah
All I gotta do
Is call you on the phone
And you'll come running home
Yeah, that's all I gotta do

And the same goes for me
Whenever you want me at all
I'll be here, yes, I will
Whenever you call
You just gotta call on me, yeah
You just gotta call on me

Oh, you just gotta call on me
