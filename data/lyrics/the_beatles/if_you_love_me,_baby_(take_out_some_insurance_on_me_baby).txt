If you leave me baby, 
I don't know what I'll do. 
I guess I would die, sweetheart 
If I don't get a kiss from you. 

Take out some insurance on me baby, 
Take out some insurance on me baby. 
Well if you ever ever say goodbye, 
I'm gonna walk right back and die. 

Oh if you want me baby, 
You got to come to me. 
I'm just like a string feeling, 
You just can't lose me. 

Take out some insurance on me baby, 
Ooo some insurance on me baby. 
Well if you ever ever say goodbye, 
I'm gonna walk right over and die. 

Well if you want me baby, 
Mm you got to come to me. 
I'm just like a strong feeling, 
You just can't lose me. 

Take out some insurance on me baby, 
Mm some insurance on me baby. 
Well if you ever ever say goodbye, 
I'm gonna walk right over and die. 

Well if you leave me baby, 
I don't know what I'll do. 
I guess I would die, sweetheart, 
If I don't get a kiss from you. 

Take out some insurance on me baby, 
Ooo some goddamn insurance on me baby. 
If you ever ever say goodbye, 
I'm gonna walk right over and die.
