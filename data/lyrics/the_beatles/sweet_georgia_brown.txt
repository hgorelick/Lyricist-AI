Well let me tell you well no chick made could be the same
As Sweet Georgia Brown
Crazy feet that dance so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown
Fellas sigh, and even cry for Sweet Georgia Brown
I tell you just why you know I dont lie

Its been said, she knocks them dead in any old town
Since she came right its a shame how she brings them down
In Liverpool she even dare to criticize the Beatles hair
With their whole fan club standing there, I mean Sweet Georgia Brown
Alright

I say this group is absolutely marvelous with the piano
Dont you think so?
Not too commercial boys, not too commercial!

When it comes to music Sweet Georgia known to mind
Dont buy clothes at fashion shows but she still looks fine
Snap chicks cry, they want to die when Georgie does the twist
I never would try to tell you just why use your imagination

There's a DJ crazy for her living in out home town
Since she came like its a shame, she turns him down
Records that she can get are records, they ain't sent him yet
Carolina may have Dina, but that dont have Georgia Brown

Oh such Sweet Georgia
Yeah yeah yeah I mean brown, oh oh oh
Sweet Georgia Brown
