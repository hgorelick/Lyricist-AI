Ready - set - go man go
I got a gal that I love so

I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready ready ready to rock 'n' roll

Goin' down to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock 'n' roll baby, she's the apple of my eye (chorus)

Well, the flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumpin', the cats are goin' wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style (chorus)

Gonna kick off my shoes, roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock 'n' roll baby, pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left, I shuffle to the right
Gonna rock 'n' roll 'til the early early night
