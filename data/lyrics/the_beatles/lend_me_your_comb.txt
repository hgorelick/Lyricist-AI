Lend me your comb, 
It's time to go home. 
I got to go past, 
My hair is a mess 

Your mammie will scold, 
Your pappie will shout. 
Unless we come in 
The way we went out. 

Kissing you was fun honey 
But thanks for the date. 
But I must come to run honey, 
But you know baby it's getting late. 

Just wait till I say:
My darling, 
Lend me your comb. 
We got to go home. 

Kissing you was fun honey 
But thanks for the date. 
But I must come to run, honey. 
But sugar, it's getting late. 

Just wait till I 
Say: my darling, 
Lend me your comb. 
We got to go home.
