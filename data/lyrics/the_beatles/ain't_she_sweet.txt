Oh ain't she sweet, 
Well see her walking down that street. 
Yes I ask you very confidentially: 
Ain't she sweet? 

Oh ain't she nice, 
Well look her over once or twice. 
Yes I ask you very confidentially: 
Ain't she nice? 

Just cast an eye 
In her direction. 
Oh me oh my, 
Ain't that perfection? 

Oh I repeat 
Well don't you think that's kind of neat? 
Yes I ask you very confidentially: 
Ain't she sweet? 

Oh ain't she sweet, 
Well see her walking down that street. 
Well I ask you very confidentially: 
Ain't she sweet? 

Oh ain't that nice, 
Well look it over once or twice. 
Yes I ask you very confidentially: 
Ain't she nice? 

Just cast an eye 
In her direction. 
Oh me oh my, 
Ain't that perfection? 

Oh I repeat 
Well don't you think that's kind of neat? 
Yes I ask you very confidentially: 
Ain't she sweet? 

Oh ain't she sweet, 
Well see her walking down that street. 
Well I ask you very confidentially: 
Ain't she sweet? 
Well I ask you very confidentially: 
Ain't she sweet?
