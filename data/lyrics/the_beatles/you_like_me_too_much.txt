Though you've gone away this morning, you'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time if I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

You've tried before to leave me but you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

I really do and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it, I'd admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me, I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it I'd admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
