I tried to find out 
What love is all about, 
And every day 
It sure lets out. 
I see my baby 
I get week in my knees. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees. 
My pappie told me 
There'd be times like these. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees. 

We meet the gang 
And go to rocking joes. 
The cats are something 
On the heels and toes. 
I grab my baby, 
Tried to give her a squeeze. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees. 
Why must she be 
Such a doggone tease? 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees. 

She's got a way 
That makes me act like a fool. 
Spent my money, 
Then she plays me cool. 
I beg her for kisses 
On my bended knees. 
Oh won't you give me 
Some loving, baby, 
Please please please. 

Though I keep trying hard 
To make her mine, 
One day the wind will blow 
And the sun will shine. 
Till that time 
She puts my heart at ease. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees 
She locked my heart 
And threw away the keys. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees, yeah. 

She's got a way 
That makes me act like a fool. 
Spent my money, 
Then she plays me cool. 
I'm begging her for kisses 
On my bended knees. 
Oh won't you give me 
Some of your loving, baby, 
Please please please. 

Though I keep trying hard 
To make her mine, 
One day the wind will blow 
And the sun will shine. 
Till that time 
She puts my heart at ease. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees 
She locked my heart 
And threw away the keys. 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees 
There's nothing shaking 
But the leaves on the trees
