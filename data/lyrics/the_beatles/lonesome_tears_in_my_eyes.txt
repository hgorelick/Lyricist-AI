Oh baby baby baby, 
blues and sorrow, 
and I love you tomorrow, 
just suit you just fine. 
Oh baby baby baby, 
blues and sorrow, 
and I love you tomorrow, 
just suit you just fine. 

I can't forget that you told me 
so many promising lies. 
How must I forget these 
lonesome tears in my eyes? 

You've broken my heart, 
gonna do it again. 
And I can't forget 
the spell that I'm in. 
Can't forget that you told me 
so many promising lies. 
I'm a-trying to forget these 
lonesome tears in my eyes. 

You've broken my heart, 
gonna do it again. 
I can't forget 
the spell that I'm in. 
I can't forget that you told me 
so many promising lies. 
I'm a-trying to forget these 
lonesome tears in my eyes. 

Oh baby baby baby, 
blues and sorrow, 
And I love you tomorrow, 
it'll suit you just fine.
