Alan Freeman: George, is it true that you're a connoisseur of the classics?
George: No, it's just a rumour, a rumour.
Alan: Just a rumour?
George: Hmm.
Alan: Did you enjoy singing "Beethoven"?
George No. Been singing it for 28 years, now, you know.
Alan: For how long?
George: Twenty-eight years.
Alan: That's incredible. Could you manage one more performance?
George: Um, possibly.
Alan: Oh, go on, say, "yes."
George: Yes, thank you.
