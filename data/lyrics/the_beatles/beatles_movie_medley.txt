Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour!
Step right this way!

Roll up
Roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up
Roll up for the mystery tour

The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away
Waiting to take you away, take you today

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Everywhere people stare
Each and ev'ry day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
Hey, you've got to hide your love away!

Oho, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me to, ohohoho, oho
And when I ask you to be mine, ahaha
You're gonna say you love me too

It's been a hard days night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard days night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

Oh!

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah!
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
And she don't care

Jo-Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo-Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back!
Get back!
