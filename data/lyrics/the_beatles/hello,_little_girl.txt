Hello, little girl.
Hello, little girl.
Hello, little girl.

When I see you every day,
I say, mmm-mmm, hello, little girl.
When you're passing on your way,
I say, mmm-mmm, hello, little girl.
When I see you passing by,
I cry, mmm-mmm, hello, little girl.
When I try to catch your eye,
I cry, mmm-mmm, hello, little girl.

I send you flowers,
But you don't care.
You never seem to
See me standin' there.
I often wonder
What you're thinkin' of.
I hope it's me
And love, love, love.
So I hope there'll come a day when
You say, mmm-mmm, you're my little girl.

It's not the first time,
That it's happened to me.
It's been a long, lonely time
And it's so funny,
So funny to see
That I'm about to loose
My mind, mind, mind.
So I hope there'll come a day when
You say, mmm-mmm, you're my little girl.

Mmm-mmm, you're my little girl.
Mmm-hmm, you're my little girl.
Oh, yeah, you're my little girl.
