Brian Matthew: But despite the fact that the next request comes from Anton, 32 Perry Road, Sherwood, in Nottingham, it's headed "Up the Pool" and starts, "Dear Wack!" So, John, you take it from there.
John: "Dear Wack! Please, ask those gorgeous lads (hee hee) called the Beatles to sing You Really Got a Hold on Me for Di, Gus, Wizz, and me, also for the Beatles themselves, especially Paul--ha--and everybody that was in the Roy Orbison Tour. I'm a regular listener of Pop Go the Beatles--good lad, good lad--and please, tell the boys that all the girls in our office think it is a fab show. Thank you."
Brian: All right, stop the band. Oh, that's splendid and now, what are you gonna sing for us?
John: You Really Got a Hold on Me... Mother.
