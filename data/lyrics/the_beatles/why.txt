Why why can't we love again? 
Why why are you shy on love? 
If you only knew how much I love you, 
Why can't you love me again? 

Why why don't you open your heart? 
Why why are we so far apart? 
If you only knew how much I love you, 
Why can't you love me again? 

I just want your loving arms around me, yeah, 
I got to find a way to make you take me back. 

Baby won't you tell me 
Why why why why are we so far apart? 

Why why don't you open your heart? 
If you only knew how much I love you, 
Why can't you love me again? 

I just want your loving arms around me, yeah, 
I got to find a way to make you take me back. 

Baby won't you tell me 
Why why why why are we so far apart? 
Why why don't you open your heart? 
If you only knew how much I love you, 
Why can't you love me 
Why can't you love me 
Why can't you love me again?
