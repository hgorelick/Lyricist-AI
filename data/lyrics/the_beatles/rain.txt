If the rain comes 
They run and hide their heads 
They might as well be dead 
If the rain comes 
If the rain comes 

When the sun shines 
They slip into the shade 
(When the sun shines down)
And sip their lemonade
(When the sun shines down)
When the sun shines 
When the sun shines 

Rain, I don't mind 
Shine, the weather's fine 

I can show you 
That when it starts to rain 
(When the rain comes down)
Everything's the same 
(When the rain comes down)
I can show you 
I can show you 

Rain, I don't mind 
Shine, the weather's fine 

Can you hear me?
That when it rains and shines
(When it rains and shines)
It's just a state of mind
(When it rains and shines)
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
