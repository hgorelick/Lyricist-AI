Brian Matthew: The next few minutes, we're in the lap of the gods and the hands of the Beatles. In my young days, when I was a lad, they used to have actors in films and now that they--
Paul: Yes?
John: Hey! Listen!
Paul: It's all changed, now, Brian. They're not doing that, no actors.
John: It's all changed, now.
Brian: But this is what I wonder. In those days, the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor. Did you find that?
John: No, no, no, those were the good bits in the film. You should have seen the rest.
Brian: Yes?
John: Rubbish!
Brian: Was it, really?
John: Even worse, yes.
Brian: Who was worst?
John: Oh, Paul.
Brian: I see.
Paul: I think John was about the worst.
John: No, it was you.
Paul: Oh, Ringo was very good. He was. He's a good lad.
Brian: He was. They're saying he's a new Charlie Chaplin. Do you think that's right?
John: He was miming.
Paul: You, too, with Jason.
John: Oh, yes, he's an old one. Okay, Ring?
Brian: Beginning to look like that. Now, then--
Ringo: All right, John. Can you hear me?
Paul: Can you hear him? Hello!
Brian: Not really. I hope not. I hope not!
John: We brought you the flowers, Ring.
Brian: He's not allowed to talk.
Ringo: Eh?
John: We brought you the flowers.
Ringo: Oh, good.
John: And the grapes.
Ringo: Oh, I like grapes.
Paul: He likes grapes.
George: We've been to Portugal.
Brian: Guess who's, guess who's top of the pops in Portugal, then.
All: Who?
Brian: Los Beatles.
John: Los Beatles? Great, great laugh.
Brian: I don't suppose you know the title of your film in Portuguese?
John: No. Crinsk dee Night?
Brian: Could be. Let's hear the number, shall we?
John: Right.
