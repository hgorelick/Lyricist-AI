I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here
So I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone
Please let me know

I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong
I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
I still love her
