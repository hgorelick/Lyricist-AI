How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be?
And have you travelled very far?
Far as the eye can see

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there?
Nothing that doesn't show

Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo
What a thing to do!
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?

Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo
What a thing to do!
(Baby)
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
(Oh)

Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man (baby)
Baby, you're a rich man, too

(Wahoo!)
Baby, you're a rich (whoo) man
Baby, you're a (hey) rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
(Oh)
