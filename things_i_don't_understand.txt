How tides control the sea
And what becomes of me
How little things can slip out of your hands
How often people change
Though two remain the same
Why things don't always turn out as you plan
These are things that I don't understand
Yeah these are things that I don't understand

(I can't) And I can't decide
(Wrong) Oh my wrong from right
(Day) Or my day from night
(Or dark) Or the dark from light
(I love) But I love this life

How infinite is space
And who decides your fate
Why everything will dissolve into sand
How to avoid defeat
Where truth and fiction meet
Why nothing ever turns out as you plan
These are things that I don't understand
Yeah these are things that I don't understand

(I can't) And I can't decide
(Wrong) Oh my wrong from right
(Day) Or my day from night
(Or dark) Or the dark from light
(I love) But I love this life''''''''''''''''
