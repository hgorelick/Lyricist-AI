So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention, do you?
I know you don't listen to me
Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you?
But on and on from the moment I wake, to the moment I sleep 
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care
Oh Did you want me to change?
But I'd change for good
And I want you to know that you'll always get your way
I wanted to say

Don't you shiver, shiver 
Sing it loud and clear, I'll always be waiting for you

So you know how much I need you
But you never even see me, do you?
And is this my final chance of getting you?
And on and on from the moment I wake, to the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care, if you care
Oh Did you want me to change?
Well I'd change for good
And I want you to know that you'll always get your way
I wanted to say

Don't you shiver, don't you shiver
Sing it loud and clear, I'll always be waitin' for you

Yeah I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you, for you
I will always be waiting

And it's you I see but you don't see me
And it's you I hear so loud and so clear
I sing it loud and clear and I'll always be waiting for you

So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me''''''''''''''''''''
