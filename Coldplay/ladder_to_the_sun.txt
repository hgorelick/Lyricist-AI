From the very start 
it came apart
it broke up into pieces and
there's a chance i could've missed it
It could risked it 
but I put myself into your hands 

Cause you're not just anyone 
You're a ladder to the sun 
Oh you're not just anyone 
You're a ladder to the sun 

I could run my courses and
Opposing forces 
and all men are just mortals, and
Oh if you want me then you can have me 
Come on, take me, oh baby grab it 

Cause if you want me then you can have me
Cause you're not just anyone 
You're a ladder to the sun 
You're not just anyone 
You're a ladder to the sun 

Oh now boy what you been and done
you set a course that you couldn't run
oh now boy what you been and done

I had it all and I risked it
I had it all and I risked it all 
And I risked it all 
And I risked it all

A ladder to the 
A Ladder to the sun 
A ladder to the 
A ladder to the sun 

A ladder to the 
A ladder to the sun 
And I risked it all 
A ladder to the 
A ladder to the sun''''''''''''''
