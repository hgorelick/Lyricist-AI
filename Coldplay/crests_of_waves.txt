It could be worse
I could be alone
I could be locked in here on my own
Like a stone that suddenly drops
It never stops, no

I could be lost
Or I could be saved
Calling out from beneath the waves
Beaten down by this ocean rain
Never again
Never again

Ohhh, ohhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhhhh
Ohhh, ohhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhhhh
Ohhh, ohhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhhhh

Screaming out from the crests of waves

It could be worse
Bitter or sweet
You could be snapped from the jaws of defeat
Or like a light lit upon a beach 
Wear your heart on your sleeve
Oh

You want to stop before you begin
You want to sink when you know you could swim
You want to stop just before you begin
Never give in
Never give in

Ohhh, ohhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhhhh
Ohhh, ohhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhhhh
Ohhh, ohhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhhhh

Screaming out from the crests of waves

Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Except life and the love you make

Ohhh, ohhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhhhh
Ohhh, ohhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhhhh
Ohhh, ohhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhhhh

Screaming out from the crests of waves

Ohhh, ohhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhhhh
Ohhh, ohhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhhhh
Ohhh, ohhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhhhh

Screaming out from the crests of waves
Where you're longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves
Where you're longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves''''''''''''''''
