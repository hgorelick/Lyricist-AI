Flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love
 
And I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
Fly on
 
Flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned and rise
Following them up

Still, I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next, you know they're gone
Fly on

Fly on, oh
So fly on, ride through
Maybe one day, I'll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day, I can fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on''''''''''''''''''''''
