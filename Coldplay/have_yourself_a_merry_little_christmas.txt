(This is Take 4 of "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas". Just for K-ROQ Los Angeles)


Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas
Let Your Heart Be Light
From Now On, Our Troubles Will Be Out Of Sight

Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas
Make The Yuletide Gay
From Now On, Our Troubles Will Be Far Away

And Here We Are, As In Olden Days
Happy Golden Days Of Yore
Faithful Friends Who Are Dear To Us
Gather Near To Us
Once More

Through The Years, We All Will Be Together
If The Fates Allow
Hang A Shining Star Upon The Highest Bough
And Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas Now
And Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas Now''''''''''''''
