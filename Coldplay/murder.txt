Murder, they're coming to get us
Coming to get us and the way we hide
Murder, see it all around ya
See it all around us, and the way we hide
Murder, they're coming to get us
They're coming to get us and the way we hide
Way we hide

Tie me to a tree
Tie my hands above my head 
Sing a song to me 
Sing a song like what you said 

'Cause they're gonna murder me 
They're gonna track me down 
And even before I sleep
I crumble down

Come spit at us 
Come and throw your weight around 
Come and fight with us 
Try and knock us to the ground

(Sing it)
Oh they're gonna murder me 
And they're gonna track me down 
And even before I sleep
I scream murder

Oh now what could it possibly gain?
Oh what could it possibly gain?
Oh now what could it possibly gain?
Oh yeah what could it possibly gain?

Murder, they're coming to get us
Coming to get us and the way we hide
Murder, see it all around ya
See it all around us, and the way we hide
Murder, they're coming to get us
Coming to get us and the way we hide
Murder, see it all around ya
See it all around ya and the way we hide''''''''''''''''
