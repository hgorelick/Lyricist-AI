I know it's over 
Before she says
I know the falls that the water face
I know it's over
An ocean awaits for a storm
The sun on snow 
Rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over 
A parting of ways
And it's done
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun
Oh ah ooh ooh ooh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
Could have been lost
Would have been saved
Oh ah, ooh ooh ooh
Now we're stopping the world
stopping its spin
but come on dont give up don't say we give in
Don't say it's over
Don't say we're done
Ah didnt we have fun?

I know it's over
Before she says
"Know someone else has taken your place"
"I know it's over"
Icarus says to the sun
The Sword sinks in
Lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight til its over
Fight til it's done
Oh oh oh oh oh
Didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh ah ooh ooh ooh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost,
We would have been saved
Oh ah ah ah ah
Now we're stopping the world
Stopping in its tracks but
Nothing's too broken to find a way back
So before it's over
Before you run
Ah ah
Didn't we have fun?

Cause you and me we were always meant to
Always meant to be
We were always meant to always meant to

You and me we were always meant to
Always meant to be

Wooh ooh ooh ooh oo ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
oh oh didn't we have fun?

But then
Maybe we could again''''''''''''''''
