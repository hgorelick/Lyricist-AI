Stole a key
And took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free

I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
I saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smashed my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose, come burst in the concrete
Be a cartoon heart

Light a fire, fire the spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart, we'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark

All the boys, all the girls, all that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls, all the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows as the room is spinning
We'll run riot, we'll be glowing in the dark

So, so, reminiscing wild
We'll be glowing in the dark''''''''''''''''''
