So I was an idiot
I was a god-damn idiot
Because I came here so violent
Because I came around here so violent

I said yes I was an idiot
I was a god-damn idiot
Because I made you think for it
Because I came round here to think for it

And sing it
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive

My love, my love, where have you been?
My love, my love, where did you go?
My love, my love, what have you seen?
My love, you're such an idiot

Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot

I was an idiot
I fell down like a god damn idiot
Because I came here to bring them down
Because I came round here to fight them down
I said yes I felt like an idiot
I was a god damn idiot

Sing it
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive

My love, my love, where have you been?
My love, my love, where did you go?
My love, my love, what have you seen?
My love, you're such an idiot

Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot

Listen now, it's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life

Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive''''''''''''''
