Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep,
I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me,
But I wake up,
Yes I wake up,
Smiling.

Sometimes I feel overcharged, it's surprising,
Surprisingly good to be moving around,
So I wake up,
Yes I wake up,
Smiling.

So what? I feel fine,
I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life,
I'm alright, I feel good,
So I'll go, I'll try to start moving.

Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep,
And I've got to get going 
So much that I wanted to do,
But I wake up,
Smiling.

And this could be my last chance,
I'm saving my only chance,
And this could be my last chance,
No more keeping my feet on the ground.

Sometimes I feel overcharged, it's surprising,
Surprisingly good to be moving around,
And I move,
I wake up,
Smiling.

So what? I feel fine,
I feel OK, I've seen the lighter side of life,
I'm alright, I feel good,
So I'll go, well it's time to start moving on.

And this could be my last chance,
I'm saving my only chance,
And this could be my last chance,
So no more keeping my feet on the ground.

I'm not gonna keep them, 
I'm not gonna keep them down''''''''''''''''
