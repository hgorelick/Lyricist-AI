They put the world in a tin can
Black market, contraband
And it hurt just a little bit
When they sliced and packaged it
In a long black trench coat
Two hands around the throat
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes

There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
How did the clowns ever get control?
Ah, if your hear can you let me know
How can they invade it
When it's so complicated?
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

That's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you learned

That's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna give up

Oooohhhhh...

And there's something missing
Seems like there's nobody listening
If you're running in a circle
How can you be too careful?
We don't wanna be man trapped
We don't wanna be shrink-wrapped

Ohhhhhhhhh...

We just wanna get it right sometimes
We just wanna get it right sometimes

That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
But you can't believe a word

That's how you see the world
Ah, don't you worry yourself
Cause nobody can hurt you...

Oooooh
Ooooooooh

Ooooooooh

That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world''''''''''''''''
