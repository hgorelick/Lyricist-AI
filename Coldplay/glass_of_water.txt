Scared of losin' all the time
He wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
With ripples and the rhymes
He asked, "Will I see heaven in mine?"

That is just the way it was
And nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
They say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water
The riddles and the rhymes
"Will I see heaven in mine?"
Ohhhh

Son
Don't ask
Neither how full nor empty
Is your glass
Cling
To the mast
Spend your whole life 
Living in the past
Going nowhere fast

So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And you chime
"Stars in heaven align"
Ohhhhhhhh

Son
Don't ask
Neither how full nor empty
Is your glass
Cling
To the mast
Spend your whole life 
Living in the past
Going nowhere fast

What are we drinking when we're done?
Glasses of water''''''''''''''''''
