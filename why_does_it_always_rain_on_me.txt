I can't sleep tonight
Everybody's saying that it's alright
Still I can't close my eyes
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights

Sunny days
Where have you gone?
I get the strangest feeling
You belong

Why does it always rain on me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why does it always rain on me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning

I can't stand myself
I'm being held up by an invisible man
Still life on a shelf when
I got my mind on something else

Sunny days
Oh, where have you gone?
I get the strangest feeling
You belong

Why does it always rain on me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why does it always rain on me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning

Oh, where did the blue skies go?
And why is it raining so cold?
It's so cold

I can't sleep tonight
Everybody saying that it's alright
Still I can't close my eyes
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights

Sunny days
Oh, where have you gone?
I get the strangest feeling
You belong

Why does it always rain on me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why does it always rain on me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning

Oh, where did the blue skies go?
Why is it raining so cold?
So cold

Why does it always rain on me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why does it always rain on me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning

Why does it always rain on me?
Why does it always rain on?
Ohh''''''''''''''
